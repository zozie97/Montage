### Scrape Montage

My original idea for collecting images was travel, from that original idea i have made a few examples such as "snow", "ocean" and "aurora". I like how these all are very different and look really interesting in their grids. I filtered out any images that did not directly correspond with the theme. I really liked how the color grid turned out, it was easily readable and flowed really nicely, you could easily tel that it was filtering by color which made it a nice grid to look at asthetically. The smart grid turned out really interesting as it grouped the images in ways you wouldnt pick out initally, for example in the "snow" it grouped trees together and flat landscapes together.

In my final custom grid, you can see that it has grouped the images like the smartgrid, not the colour grid. It works somewhat diagonally from images in the top left corner that have rocks in them to images in the bottom right corner than have smooth beaches. On the opposite diagonal is seems to have more lighter toned images compared to the diagonal with the rocks to beaches where its more darker toned. There is also groupings of pastel coloured sunsets and darker yellow/orange sunsets. 

Overall i like how this project has turned out, there have been quite a few problems throughout the project but i have been able to fix these issues. The main issue i had was with scraping images from flickr. I worked out to grab the images from Flickr now, they need to be either from a specific person or tags not just from your search. This was because of Flickrs autoscroll function. This has allowed me to download well over the 256 needed images instead of only 22 like last time.
